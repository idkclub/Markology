# Markology

An opinionated, zettelkasten-inspired note creation and linking tool.

## Supports:

- Offline usage and search (via [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift)).
- iCloud syncing.

## Why?

- To recall a concept, while only remembering what it related to.
- To organize thoughts, without needing a heirarchy.
- To create and discover interesting connections.
- To track new knowledge, in a way that makes it easy to build on.
