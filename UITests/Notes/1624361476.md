> Using these two simple actions, you can build up your own knowledge base to both promote memory and discover of new insights.

Markology is inspired by the [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method of note taking. Our brains do not create strong hierarchies or group thoughts into neatly divided folders. They exist as a collection of thoughts with associative links. By recording these small thoughts and their links, you can search for ideas in Markology and surprise yourself with information you didn't realize was related.

- When you're editing a note, tap the "Add Link" button to search or create related notes to form a connection.
